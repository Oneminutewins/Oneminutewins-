          <p>According to reports from the Financial Times, LEGO, the world’s largest toymaker, has announced plans to develop video games in-house. This marks a significant shift from its traditional approach of partnering with third-party studios for game development. The move is part of LEGO’s strategy to expand its digital presence, leveraging its iconic brick-building legacy to create immersive gaming experiences.</p>
          <p>The company aims to build a dedicated game development team, potentially starting with smaller projects before tackling larger titles. This in-house effort could lead to new LEGO-themed games, possibly expanding beyond the popular LEGO Star Wars and LEGO Marvel series developed with TT Games. Industry experts suggest this could also involve innovative gameplay mechanics, such as augmented reality or collaborative building modes.</p>
          <p>LEGO’s decision comes as the video game market continues to grow, with the global industry valued at over $200 billion in 2025. By controlling its game development, LEGO hopes to strengthen its brand and connect with younger audiences who are increasingly active in gaming. Stay tuned for more updates on this exciting venture!</p>
