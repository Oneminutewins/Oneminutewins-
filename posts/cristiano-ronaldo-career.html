        <div class="post-content">
          <p>Cristiano Ronaldo, often hailed as one of the greatest footballers of all time, has had a career spanning over two decades by 2025. Born on February 5, 1985, in Madeira, Portugal, Ronaldo began his professional career with Sporting CP before moving to Manchester United in 2003. At United, he won his first Ballon d’Or in 2008 and helped the team secure three Premier League titles and a UEFA Champions League trophy.</p>
          <p>In 2009, Ronaldo transferred to Real Madrid for a then-world-record fee of €94 million. His nine years at Madrid were phenomenal—he scored 450 goals in 438 appearances, becoming the club’s all-time top scorer. Ronaldo won four more Ballon d’Or awards, four Champions League titles, and two La Liga titles during this period. His rivalry with Lionel Messi during this time defined an era of football.</p>
          <p>Ronaldo moved to Juventus in 2018, where he continued his scoring prowess, winning two Serie A titles and adding 101 goals in 134 matches. In 2021, he returned to Manchester United, and in 2023, he joined Al-Nassr in Saudi Arabia, where he continues to play as of 2025. By March 2025, Ronaldo has scored over 900 career goals, a record unmatched in football history, and has won 5 Ballon d’Or awards and 5 Champions League titles.</p>
          <p>Off the pitch, Ronaldo’s work ethic, fitness regimen, and philanthropy have made him a global icon. He’s donated millions to charities and disaster relief efforts, and his CR7 brand—encompassing clothing, fragrances, and hotels—has added to his $1.2 billion net worth. At 40 years old in 2025, Ronaldo shows no signs of slowing down, aiming to play until his mid-40s!</p>
